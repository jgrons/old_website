	<p style="font-size:20px; font-family: palatino"> My research is centered on the development of quantitative methods that leverage modern digital data sources,
     both clinical and non-clinical, to enhance our understanding of human health and improve healthcare. In the last 
     decade, the widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHR) has generated massive amounts of routinely
     recorded medical data for use in translational research. More recently, the ubiquity of the smartphone has enabled
     passive and continuous data collection of health and behavior outside of traditional clinical settings. However, 
     data heterogeneity, quality issues, and privacy concerns impose unique analytical challenges to the analysis of
     EHR and mobile health data. These challenges have motivated my statistical interests in two primary areas: 
     (i) predictive modeling with limited or no outcome information and (ii) meta-analysis in finite samples and 
     under data sharing restrictions.
