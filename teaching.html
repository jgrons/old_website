<ul>
	<li> Biostatistics Doctoral Preparatory Course  (Lecturer: Summer 2016)</li>
	
	<em>   Course for incoming PhD students in Biostatistics.  Topics covered include statistical computing in R, 
		Monte Carlo simulation, maximum likelihood theory, resampling methods, and topics in
		generalized linear modeling.
	</em>
	
  <li> BST 222: Basics of Statistical Inference (Teaching Assistant: Fall 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016)</li>
	
	<em>   This course provides a basic, yet thorough introduction to the probability theory 
		and mathematical statistics that underlie many of the commonly used techniques in 
		public health research. Topics covered include probability distributions, 
		finite sampling distributions, parameter estimation, confidence intervals, 
		hypothesis testing, regression, and resampling methods.  Students are also introduced to
		R programming and statistical simulation studies.
	</em>
	
	<li> BST 203: Principles of Biostatistics II (Teaching Assistant: Summer 2013)</li>
	
	<em>   The second part of an introductory biostatistics series continuing to explore inference in greater depth.  
		Topics covered include the comparison of two means, analysis of variance, non-parametric methods, 
		inference on proportions, contingency tables, multiple 2 X 2 tables, correlation, simple regression, 
		multiple regression and logistic regression, analysis of survival data, and sampling theory. 
		Data analysis is emphasized and implemented in STATA.</em>
