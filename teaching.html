	I have always loved teaching and have had rich experiences as both a teaching assistant (TA) and instructor
		during my undergraduate and graduate years.  As an undergrad, I developed an outreach-based
		course that brought together UC Berkeley students to assist high schoolers in the Bay Area
		with the college application process.  During graduate school, I taught statistical courses ranging
		from introductory applied statistics for medical researchers to advanced methods for
		biostatistics PhD students.
