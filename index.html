	<p> I'm a fifth year PhD candidate in the <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/"> Department of 
		Biostatistics </a> at Harvard University
		where I am fortunate enough to work with <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tianxi-cai/"> 
		Dr. Tianxi Cai.</a> 
		My thesis work focuses on 
		the development of efficient machine learning methods for risk prediction in settings 
		where outcome information, unlike feature information, is difficult to obtain.
		</p>
	
		<p>
		I received my undergraduate degree in <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu"> Applied Mathematics</a> at 
		the University of California at Berkeley.  I love visiting my alma mater - especially during the freezing 
			Boston winters.  GO BEARS!
