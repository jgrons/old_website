<div class="blurb">
	<h1> Welcome!</h1>
	<p> I'm a fifth year PhD candidate in the <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/"> Department of 
		Biostatistics</a> at Harvard University
		where I am fortunate enough to work with <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tianxi-cai/"> Dr. Tianxi Cai </a>. 
		My thesis work focuses on 
		the development of efficient machine learning methods for risk prediction in settings 
		where outcome information, unlike features, are difficult to obtain.
