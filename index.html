	Welcome to my site!  
	</p>	
		
		<p style="font-size:20px; font-family: palatino">
		I'm a data scientist at Alphabet's <a href="https://verily.com/"> 
	Verily Life Sciences</a>.  Prior to joining Verily, I received my PhD in  Biostatistics 
	at <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/"> Harvard University </a> under the direction of 
		Professor <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tianxi-cai/"> Tianxi Cai</a>.
	I was also a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Biomedical Data Science at the <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/dbds.html"> Stanford School of Medicine </a>
	with Professor <a href="https://statistics.stanford.edu/people/lu-tian"> Lu Tian</a>.

		I fell in love with statistics as an undergraduate in the Department of
		Mathematics at <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/"> UC Berkeley</a>
		and have been generally excited about all things machine learning and statistics ever since. 
		I am particularly interested in applications to healthcare.  Most of my research focuses on the development
		of methods for estimation and evaluation of risk prediction models built with 
		modern digital data such as electronic health records and mobile health data.

		When I'm not doing statistics, you'll likely find me running, cooking, or walking my energetic dog, Teddy.
