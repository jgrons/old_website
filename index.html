	<p style="font-size:20px; font-family: palatino"> Welcome to my site!  I am a data scientist at Alphabet's <a href="https://verily.com/"> 
	Verily Life Sciences</a>.  Prior to joining Verily, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department
	of Biomedical Data Science at the <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/dbds.html"> Stanford School of Medicine </a>
	with Professor <a href="https://statistics.stanford.edu/people/lu-tian"> Lu Tian</a>.  Before that, I spent five
	amazing years at Harvard earning my PhD in <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/"> Biostatistics </a>
	under the direction of Professor <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tianxi-cai/"> Tianxi Cai</a>.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:20px; font-family: palatino">
		My primary statistical interest is in risk prediction with modern digital data sources such as electronic
		health records and mobile health data.  When I am not doing statistics, you'll likely find me running,
		cooking, or walking my adorable dog, Teddy.
