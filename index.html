	<p> Welcome to my site!  I am currently a data scientist at Alphabet's <a href="https://verily.com/"> 
	Verily Life Sciences </a>.  Prior to joining Verily, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department
	of Biomedical Data Science at the <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/dbds.html"> Stanford School of Medicine </a>
	with Professor <a href="https://statistics.stanford.edu/people/lu-tian"> Lu Tian </a>.  Before that, I spent five
	awesome years at Harvard earning my PhD in <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/"> Biostatistics </a>
